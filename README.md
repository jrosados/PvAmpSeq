# PvAmpSeq
Code and data repository for Amplicon sequencing of _Plasmodium vivax_ as described in the article **Amplicon deep sequencing assay for studying _Plasmodium vivax_ infections at the clonal level**

The [raw_data](https://github.com/jrosados/PvAmpSeq/tree/main/raw_data) directory contains raw data, such as AmpSeqR output and epidemiological data needed to run the scripts. These data must be filtered using scripts 1 and 2. 

The assembled microhaplotype and epidemiological data of both Solomon Islands and Peru cohorts can be found in the [clean_data](https://github.com/jrosados/PvAmpSeq/tree/main/cleaned_data) directory for easier use and analysis such as MOI, classification of recurrent infections, IBD dcifer estimates, Pv3R estimates.
